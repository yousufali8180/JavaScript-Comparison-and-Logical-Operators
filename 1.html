==	equal to	x == 8	false	
x == 5	true	
x == "5"	true	
===	equal value and equal type	x === 5	true	
x === "5"	false	
!=	not equal	x != 8	true	
!==	not equal value or not equal type	x !== 5	false	
x !== "5"	true	
x !== 8	true	
>	greater than	x > 8	false	
<	less than	x < 8	true	
>=	greater than or equal to	x >= 8	false
